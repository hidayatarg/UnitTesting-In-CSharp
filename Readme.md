### Test the outcome of a Method
When your method has more than 10 lines. It will be hard to test which part.


## Naming Convention
[MethodName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedBehaviour]

## Setup Decorator
Before starting a new test method with this decorator will be initialized and give us a fresh instance of that class. 

## Testing Strings
While testing strings try to make assertion more general, In case you make them specific its possible to break the test.

IgnoreCase for not caring about case sensitivity
